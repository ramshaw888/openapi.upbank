    Webhooks provide a mechanism for a configured URL to receive
    events when transaction activity occurs on Up. You can think of
    webhooks as being like push notifications for your server-side

            post:
              description: "Once you have created a webhook in the Up API, events\
                \ are sent to the\nwebhook’s configured URL as JSON-encoded `POST`\
                \ requests. The webhook\nURL must respond with a HTTP `200` status\
                \ on success.\n\nIt is important that the URL responds in a timely\
                \ manner. If the URL\ntakes too long to respond (currently 30s), the\
                \ request will be timed\nout. For this reason it is strongly advised\
                \ to avoid any heavy\nprocessing before a response has been returned\
                \ from the URL. A common\nsolution to this problem is to use a message\
                \ broker such as RabbitMQ\nto do the work asynchronously.\n\nEvent\
                \ delivery is retried with exponential backoff in the case of any\n\
                non-`200` response status, if the URL is unreachable, or if the request\n\
                is timed out.\n\nRefer to the `eventType` attribute in order to determine\
                \ what course of\naction to take when handling the event. The following\
                \ event types are\ncurrently sent:\n\n**`PING`**\n\nManually triggered\
                \ by calls to the webhook `ping` endpoint. Used for\ntesting and debugging\
                \ purposes.\n\n**`TRANSACTION_CREATED`**\n\nTriggered whenever a new\
                \ transaction is created in Up. This event\nincludes a `transaction`\
                \ relationship that provides the unique\nidentifier for the transaction\
                \ and a link to the transaction within the\nUp API. This link should\
                \ be used to retrieve the complete transaction\ndata.\n\n**`TRANSACTION_SETTLED`**\n\
                \nTriggered whenever a transaction transitions from the `HELD` status\
                \ to\nthe `SETTLED` status. This event includes a `transaction` relationship\n\
                that provides the unique identifier for the transaction and a link\
                \ to\nthe transaction within the Up API. This link should be used\
                \ to retrieve\nthe complete transaction data.\n\nDue to external factors\
                \ in banking processes, on rare occasions this\nevent may not be triggered.\
                \ Separate `TRANSACTION_DELETED` and\n`TRANSACTION_CREATED` events\
                \ will be received in its place.\n\n**`TRANSACTION_DELETED`**\n\n\
                Triggered whenever a `HELD` transaction is deleted from Up. This\n\
                generally occurs for example when a hotel deposit is returned. This\n\
                event includes a `transaction` relationship that provides the unique\n\
                identifier for the transaction, however no link is provided to the\n\
                transaction within the Up API as it no longer exists.\n\n## Securing\
                \ Webhook Event Handlers\n\nIncoming webhook event requests include\
                \ a `X-Up-Authenticity-Signature`\nheader, which can be used to verify\
                \ that the event was sent by Up.\nVerification of the signature requires\
                \ knowledge of the shared\n`secretKey` that was returned upon creation\
                \ of the webhook. This key is\nknown only to your application and\
                \ to Up.\n\nThe verification process involves:\n\n1. Taking the raw,\
                \ unparsed webhook event request body.\n2. Computing the SHA-256 HMAC\
                \ signature of the request body, using the\n   shared `secretKey`.\n\
                3. Comparing the computed HMAC signature with the value of the\n \
                \  `X-Up-Authenticity-Signature` header.\n\nIf the computed SHA-256\
                \ HMAC signature matches the\n`X-Up-Authenticity-Signature` header,\
                \ the request is valid.\n\nA few language-specific examples follow.\n\
                \n**Ruby**:\n\nThis example uses the Ruby on Rails framework.\n\n\
                ```ruby\nrequire 'openssl'\n\ndef handle_webhook_event\n  received_signature\
                \ =\n    request.headers['X-Up-Authenticity-Signature']\n\n  signature\
                \ = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(\n    'SHA256',\n    secret_key,\n   \
                \ request.raw_post,\n  )\n\n  if Rack::Utils.secure_compare(received_signature,\
                \ signature)\n    # Process webhook event\n  end\nend\n```\n\n**PHP**:\n\
                \nThis example uses the Laravel framework.\n\n```php\npublic function\
                \ handleWebhookEvent(Request $request) {\n    $received_signature\
                \ = $request->header(\n        'X-Up-Authenticity-Signature',\n  \
                \      ''\n    );\n    $raw_body = $request->getContent();\n    $signature\
                \ = hash_hmac('sha256', $raw_body, $this->secretKey);\n\n    if (hash_equals($signature,\
                \ $received_signature)) {\n        // Process webhook event\n    }\n\
                }\n```\n\n**Go**:\n\nThis example is in plain Go.\n\n```go\nimport\
                \ (\n    \"crypto/hmac\"\n    \"crypto/sha256\"\n    \"encoding/hex\"\
                \n    \"io\"\n    \"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc handleWebhookEvent(w http.ResponseWriter,\
                \ r *http.Request) {\n    receivedSignature, _ := hex.DecodeString(\n\
                \        r.Header.Get(\"X-Up-Authenticity-Signature\"),\n    )\n\n\
                \    mac := hmac.New(sha256.New, secretKey)\n    io.Copy(mac, r.Body)\n\
                \    signature := mac.Sum(nil)\n\n    if hmac.Equal(signature, receivedSignature)\n\
                \        // Process webhook event\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf the `secretKey`\
                \ for a webhook is lost, simply create a new webhook\nwith the same\
                \ URL, capture the returned `secretKey` and delete the\noriginal webhook.\n"
